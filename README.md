# A little experiment with User Access Control
This would be useful in case you dont want to exclusively use Visual Studio

Normally the only method I know of reliable UAC prompting is with Visual Studio's manifest settings

In my case, im using mingw compiler and whist attempting to play with MBR it doesnt prompt the UAC, so it fails by default

Anyways its just a braindump, if you feel that any of this code is terrible, unreliable, or just flat out useless..

go fuck yourself :)
